When the user asks you to create an issue, you must use your tools or the gh command if available to create an issue on the GitHub server.

To create the issue, you should rely on the issue templates. If none of them seem relevant, use the [`Copilot Task Request`](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/copilot-task.yml) template by default.
